# February 18, 2026 - ARR Bot Notes

## Dashboard Improvements
- Added GitHub version control for dashboard code
- Created dashboard-debug skill for Chrome DevTools debugging
- Added drag-and-drop reordering for kanban
- Added sidebar "Completed" section
- Fixed duplicate column bug (removed "new" concept, now only "backlog")
- Fixed completed tasks showing ideas marked complete

## Bug Fixes
- Fixed null checks for all getElementById calls
- Fixed kanban button visibility (Accept/Reject only in Ideas column)
- Fixed completed items not showing (was checking wrong data structure)
- Fixed reorder API (was using wrong db reference)
- **Critical**: Removed migrateFromJson that was reloading old JSON data and overwriting SQLite changes

## Cron Jobs
- YouTube scan jobs recreated with proper delivery config
- Weekly Idea Dump added (Monday 8am) - checks for duplicates
- Kanban Task Worker runs hourly

## Database
- SQLite with sortOrder and rejected columns
- sortOrder allows priority ordering in backlog
- rejected column prevents re-adding rejected ideas

## Issues
- Had to delete old kanban.json file that was overwriting SQLite on each restart
- Database needed schema fix (added missing columns)

## Resolved
- Ideas now stick when accepted/rejected/deleted
- Completed tasks accessible from sidebar
